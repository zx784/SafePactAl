"""
SentenceBuffer — accumulates Gemini streaming text tokens and emits complete sentences.

Goal: low perceived latency for the voice agent.
  - Gemini streams tokens one by one.
  - This buffer collects them and emits a complete sentence as soon as a boundary appears.
  - The frontend receives each sentence and immediately passes it to speechSynthesis.

Sentence boundaries: .  ?  !  ،  ؟  (Arabic punctuation included)

Phase 5: full implementation with edge-case handling
  (abbreviations like "Dr.", decimal numbers "3.14", ellipsis "...", etc.)
